                  <h1>About the Speedie Corporation</h1>
                  <p class="para">The Speedie stores' were bought by the new owner AlGahyar in <em>2010</em>. He owned three small gas station on three different locations, Grand Blvd, Compton ST, and Virginia ST. They all located in <em>Saint Louis, MO</em>. He sold the one on Virginia ST. because it was very old and needed too much work to get fixed.</p>
                  <img id="left" src="Images%20&%20Videos/logo1.jpg" alt="Speedie Gas on Grand Photo" width="500">
                  <p id="push"> Only one of the three stores was open, which is the Speedie Gas station on <em>South Grand</em>. It was only a small old store with old pumps. The new owner of the Speedie put big efforts to change it to a bigger, better looking, and more active store. During time, AlGahyar changed the old look &amp; design pumps with New &amp; Nice design pumps carrying this <img id="logo" src="Images%20&%20Videos/speedielogo.jpg" alt="Speedie gas logo photo"> Speedie Logo. He didn't stop on that, but he kept upgrading his store, then, he got a big nice looking canopy with the Speedie LED light Logo on it.

                  <img id="right" src="Images%20&%20Videos/SpeedieCompton.jpg" alt="Speedie Gas on Compton" width="500">
                  <p id="left2">A while after all the big efforts he gave to his little store, he made a big surprise to the neighborhood by opening the second Speedie Gas Station on <em>Compton</em>!! It was a big and good surprise for the people who live a little bit far a way from the Speedie on <em>Grand Blvd.</em> Most of the people were happy about it because they don't have to walk all that big distant to get their daily stuff again.
                  </p>
                  <img id="carwash" src="Images%20&%20Videos/CarWash.jpg" alt="Speedie car wash" width="500">
                  <p id="clear2">Then after one year, he made his second surprise by opening a car wash,<em> The Speedie Car Wash</em>. A nice looking Design store that match the other two Speedies, and also carry the Speedie Logo. The Speedie Car Wash is a good place where you can change your car's oil. Also its a good place to fix or check any mechanical damage with your car.</p>
